~~Love Running~~
~~In this section, you will include one or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it! Don’t introduce the project as a Portfolio project for the diploma. In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target and how it will be useful to the target audience.~~

~~For example; Love Running is a site that hopes to help keep people motivated to meet up for runs on a regular basis in Dublin, Ireland. The site will be targeted toward runners who are looking for a way to socialise and keep themselves fit. Love Running will be useful for runners to see exactly when and where they should be to join the running club.~~

~~Responsice Mockup~~

~~Features~~
~~In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.~~

Favicon 
That little picture or icon that appears on the brower tab. 

Working favicon on my site: (Light mode)

Working favicon on my site: (Dark mode)

According to favicon.io "Some alternative names for favicon are browser icon, favorite icon, shortcut icon, tab icon, URL icon, and bookmark icon. The word favicon is short for “favorite icon” and originates from Internet Explorer’s “Favorites” feature which most modern browsers call “bookmarks”."

I have ensured to include the format of ICO along with PNG or SVG for several reasons:
- The ICO file format was developed by Microsoft and is the original file format for the favicon. The format is unique because it allows for multiple small images within the same file. This is advantageous because the small icons required for a favicon in ICO format (16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels) can be scaled and optimized independently. At small dimensions you can’t rely on the browser to automatically resize your icon in an optimal way. 
- The ICO format is supported by all browsers and it’s the only format that IE5 through IE10 supports. Much as Microsoft Internet Explorer had been replaced by Microsoft Edge, as I am developing a site for optimum userability across multiple browsers I thought it would be remiss of me to select a format/s that definatly excluded compatability with Internet Explorer as according to Internet Explorer's own statistics as of 2023 they still had 28 million users worldwide.

 Why bother with a favicon?
- Brand recognition and association. 
  A favicon is used to help users visually identify websites, web pages, and web applications more easily within browser tabs, bookmarks, shortcuts, and address bars more easily. It’s important to have a favicon for your website for brand recognition so that your users can easily identify your site in their browser tabs and bookmarks.

Which favicon and why? 
- Lots of websites use their product or service logo as its favicon to stay consistent with the company's brand and maintain that association people have with a certain logo as a brand or product identification. 



 NOTE TO SELF: Match Favicon to Logo 
 I'm looking for: 
 - Something that shows up and stands out on a web brower tabs no matter what color it is (i.e. light or dark mode for white or black tabs?)
 (note to self - what color does a favicon turn in dark mode? black on black? avoid black or white?) 
  - Logos selected:
  insert image (Screenprint of Dog pawprint Icon 89239 (for use in README) from icons-icons)

WCAG source: (https://www.boia.org/) Bureau of Internet Accessibility. 
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is the international standard for digital accessibility. WCAG contains a number of success criteria that apply to icons.
This criterion requires the visual presentation of text and images of text to maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. The contrast ratio refers to the difference in luminance (light) between a foreground element and its background. 

Many icons contain text, and users with vision disabilities may not be able to perceive text with a low contrast ratio. Even if an icon does not contain text, it’s a good idea to keep the icon within WCAG’s thresholds — remember, you’re including the icon because you want users to click on it. If the image is invisible to some people, it’s not doing its job.

NOTE TO SELF: Does a favicon support the equivilent of an alt description for screen readers and accessibility? 

NOTE TO SELF:

 - Might be of use as related background images? Keep accessibility in mind.

~~For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.~~

~~In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:~~

~~Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea~~
~~Testing~~
~~In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.~~

~~In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.~~

~~You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.~~

~~If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here~~

~~Validator Testing~~
~~HTML~~
~~No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator~~
~~CSS~~
~~No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator~~
~~Unfixed Bugs~~
~~You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.~~

NOTE TO SELF: add section on accessibility testing. There is a link on https://www.boia.org/ to test website.
Test Favicon
Test all Icons
Test all logos
Test background images
Test fonts chosen and default back up fonts. 
 - Original fonts chosen  font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, found to be now deleted or unsupported by Google fonts. 
 - New fonts chosen font-family: Lato, Roboto, Ubuntu
Ref recommended on https://morningtrain.dk/en/examples-of-good-fonts/
We mostly use the following fonts:
Roboto
Lato
Ubuntu
Playfair
Open Sans
We mostly use these because:
They work well digitally, whereas other fonts may be better suited for print.
The shape of the letters makes them easy to read.
They are fairly neutral fonts, so they can fit many different use cases across industries.
All of the above-mentioned fonts belong to the so-called “Sans-serif” family.
This group of fonts does not have “feet”, making it easier to read on the web where feet can quickly consist of too few pixels and become unclear to the reader.
 - Dev notes on fonts: Lato, Roboto & Ubuntu proving extremely similar and hard to discern during initial implimentation. This may resolve with further dev by using different font sizes or weight. NOt ruling out will need to reselect another font. 

Test all links internal and external. 
Test all colour choices and combinations. 
and show all results and changes made where required and why. 

~~Deployment~~
~~This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)~~

~~The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:~~
~~In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab~~
~~From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch~~
~~Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.~~
~~The live link can be found here - https://code-institute-org.github.io/love-running-2.0/index.html~~

~~Credits~~
~~In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.~~

Y~~ou can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.~~

~~Content~~
~~The text for the Home page was taken from Wikipedia Article A~~
~~Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken from Specific YouTube Tutorial~~
~~The icons in the footer were taken from Font Awesome~~
~~Media~~
~~The photos used on the home and sign up page are from This Open Source site~~
~~The images used for the gallery page were taken from this other open source site~~
~~Congratulations on completing your Readme, you have made another big stride in the direction of being a developer!~~

~~Other General Project Advice~~
~~Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!~~

~~One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through this article by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message~~

~~Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood~~
~~When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.~~

~~For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
Writing Your Best Code~~
~~HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices
Google HTML/CSS Style Guide
Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!~~

 - 404.html has been tested with HTML Validation https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea and validates without error. 
 
## Manual Testing
write out feature and say how you checked it. 
 - how I tested it in bullet points 

 A typical debugging process might look like the following:
1.	A bug is identified either by a user or by a developer during testing/development.
2.	The developer (if the bug was reported by a user) tries to reproduce the bug and verifies that it exists.
3.	The developer starts at the moment of user input, first verifying that the input is received correctly.
4.	The developer follows the code line by line, displaying output along the way until he or she identifies a problem in a function imported from an external library.
5.	The developer Googles some information about the problem or visits the external library's documentation to verify he or she is using the function properly.
6.	The developer identifies a mistake in the way they were utilizing the external library and makes the appropriate changes to the code.
7.	The developer tests the same input again verifies the code is functioning correctly and the rest of the application has not been affected and then deploys the change.

Some questions you should get in the habit of asking yourself are:
1.	What did I expect to happen when the code was run?
2.	Precisely what happened when the code was run?
3.	Am I (or is the user) submitting the correct input?
4.	Do all the variables in use in the code have the correct values?
5.	Is the data I'm working with the correct data type?
6.	Are there any functions changing or mutating the data, the input, or the output before the final step of the code?
7.	What am I literally asking the computer to do, and is that actually what I want it to do?
