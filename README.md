# Welcome to Handsome Hounds!
This is my website offering dog grooming which displays a welcome landing page, a gallery of photos of assorted dog breeds either freshly groomed or being groomed, an information panel of reasons to get your dog groomed, opening time and contact information, an enquiry & quote request form, and social media links. A 404 error page is also made to match the main web page and direct users back to the main page.  

This website was originally to be a cinema website but I decided that I might use that idea for a later project. I was advised best not to change the name of the workspace and to simply continue on.
