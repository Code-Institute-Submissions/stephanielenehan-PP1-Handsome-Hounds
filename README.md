# Welcome to Handsome Hounds!

This is my website for a dog groomers which displays contact information, reasons to get your dog groomed, opening times, a gallery of photos, an enquiry & quote request form and social media links.  

This website was originally to be a cinema website but I decided that I might use that idea for a later project. I was advised best not to change the name of the workspace and to simply continue on. 







footer: social media links Instagram, Facebook and Twitter follow the template of Coders Coffeehouse. Note to self select font.
