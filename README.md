# Welcome to Handsome Hounds!
This is my website offering dog grooming which displays a welcome landing page, a gallery of photos of assorted dog breeds either freshly groomed or being groomed, an information panel of reasons to get your dog groomed, opening time and contact information, an enquiry & quote request form, and social media links. A 404 error page is also made to match the main web page and direct users back to the main page.  

This website was originally to be a cinema website but I decided that I might use that idea for a later project. I was advised best not to change the name of the workspace and to simply continue on.

## Manual Testing
write out feature and say how you checked it. 
 - how I tested it in bullet points 

 A typical debugging process might look like the following:
1.	A bug is identified either by a user or by a developer during testing/development.
2.	The developer (if the bug was reported by a user) tries to reproduce the bug and verifies that it exists.
3.	The developer starts at the moment of user input, first verifying that the input is received correctly.
4.	The developer follows the code line by line, displaying output along the way until he or she identifies a problem in a function imported from an external library.
5.	The developer Googles some information about the problem or visits the external library's documentation to verify he or she is using the function properly.
6.	The developer identifies a mistake in the way they were utilizing the external library and makes the appropriate changes to the code.
7.	The developer tests the same input again verifies the code is functioning correctly and the rest of the application has not been affected and then deploys the change.

Some questions you should get in the habit of asking yourself are:
1.	What did I expect to happen when the code was run?
2.	Precisely what happened when the code was run?
3.	Am I (or is the user) submitting the correct input?
4.	Do all the variables in use in the code have the correct values?
5.	Is the data I'm working with the correct data type?
6.	Are there any functions changing or mutating the data, the input, or the output before the final step of the code?
7.	What am I literally asking the computer to do, and is that actually what I want it to do?
