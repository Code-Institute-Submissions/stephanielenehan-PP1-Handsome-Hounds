            <h3>Reasons to get your dog groomed</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>#1 Improve Appearance and Smell
                    So let's get this first, most obvious reason out of the way.
                    Whether you are bathing your dog to remove an unpleasant odour, or just dirt, they will emerge smelling great.  
                    A groom will help tame those flyaway hairs, sort out messy bums and make sure your dog looks great too.
                    We all hate that stinky dog house smell, so regular grooming can help eliminate those odours from your house at the same time
                </li>
                <li>#2 Keep Their Coat Healthy While Controlling Shedding
                    The bathing part of a groom, with the right products, will help remove old hair, 
                    smell, dirt and any excess oil from your dog's skin.  Think shiny coats!!
                    Brushing also has multiple benefits.  While regular brushing can reduce the need to bathe more frequently, 
                    it is also great for the health of their coats. Just like us, brushing increases the blood circulation under the fur, 
                    promoting healthy growth.
                </li>
                <li>#3 It's Not Just a Bath and Brush!
                    Many people assume that grooming your dog, will involve a quick brush and bath.  
                    If you are grooming regularly then this may sometimes be the case, but in the main, 
                    a dog groom will also address the following: 
                    **********
                    **********
                    **********
                    **********
                    **********
                </li>
                <li>#4 Increase The Bond Between You and Your Furiend
                    We all know that spending time with our dogs helps strengthen the positive relationship between us.   
                    While building up a trust during bathing, brushing and drying can take its time, at home or at a groomer, 
                    over the longer term regular grooming can help reduce stress and help with socialisation.
                    Of course, the earlier that you can start, the better. The more often you can groom your dog, the better.
                    I promise that the time and effort will pay off and your dog will learn that letting you or a groomer
                    handle various part of their body does not result in pain.
                    We actually have dogs who love to be groomed and know that future grooms and any vet checks 
                    will be much more comfortable and less stressful for them.
                </li>
                <li>#5  To Check for Health Issues
                    Grooming is the pawfect opportunity for you to check out your dog's body on a regular basis as there 
                    can be times where your dog may have developed lumps, bumps, cuts, grazes or even swelling.  
                    These may be in places that you don't necessarily spot during your day to day interactions with them.  
                    Additional things to look out for include fleas or ticks, blocked anal glands, ears, teeth, 
                    the brightness of eyes and coat.
                    Regular grooming at home will help you spot any issues early but is not intended to be a substitute for 
                    a veterinary health check.  Do make sure you have regular appointments or check in with them if you find 
                    something that concerns you.  Noâ€¦.. step away from asking facebook.  Book that vet appointment instead!!!

                    #6 In Summary:
                    The reality is that all five reasons to groom your dog, really come down to one thing:  
                    your dog cannot always communicate to you when there is a problem or that it needs groomed.  
                    They are 100% reliant on you to make great decisions for them 
                    whether it's food, water, grooming or their overall health.
                    The one thing that binds us all, is our love of dogs and by grooming our dogs regularly, 
                    we can ensure that they are healthy, free of discomfort and happy too.
